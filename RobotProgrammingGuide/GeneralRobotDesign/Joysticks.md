# Joysticks

A joystick is a standard computer joystick, much like you’d use for a flight simulator game. In the past, we have used the Logitech Xtreme 3D Pro, which has 12 buttons, primary X and Y axes, a throttle axis, and a directional hat. Before 2020, our team typically used a single joystick as the driver’s primary input method.
