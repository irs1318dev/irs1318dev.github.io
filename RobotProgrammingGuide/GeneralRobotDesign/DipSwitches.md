# Dip Switches

Dip switches are simple toggle switches used to switch between different modes on the robot. Our team historically used dip switches to select which of several preprogrammed autonomous routines to use without changing any code or relying on the Smart Dashboard. In 2019, we started using the Smart Dashboard to choose the autonomous routine.
