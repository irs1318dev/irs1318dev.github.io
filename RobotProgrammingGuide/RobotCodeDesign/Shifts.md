# Shifts

Sometimes there arenâ€™t enough buttons on the joystick to accommodate the number of operations and macros we want available to the driver and/or co-driver. We can define "shifts" that allow the same button to mean different things depending on when another button is pressed. These shifts are described in the `ButtonMap`.
