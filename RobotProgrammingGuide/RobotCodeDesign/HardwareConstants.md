# HardwareConstants

Similar to `ElectronicsConstants` and `TuningConstants`, we store facts about the robot’s dimensions and components as constants in the `HardwareConstants` class. This tends to include things like the diameter of the wheels and the width of the robot, which may be useful for calculations during autonomous mode or for determining the robot’s position and orientation on the field.
